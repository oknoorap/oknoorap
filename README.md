## Hi 👋 I am Ribhararnus Pracutian

I'm a hobbyist developer who loves to have fun creating indie projects on the weekends. I'm a big fan of pixel art, even though I don't have any artistic talent. I also love holding and learning about cryptocurrencies and the exciting world of blockchain technology. 🦄🎨❤️💰🤖
