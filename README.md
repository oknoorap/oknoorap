## Hi 👋 I am Ribhararnus Pracutian

On weekends, I enjoy pursuing my passion for indie projects as a hobbyist developer.  
Despite my lack of artistic ability, I have a keen interest in pixel art.  
I have a lot of small projects as a hobby, but currently working on:

_ Working on NovelOS (98%)
- Working on Modern Site Builder (60%)
- Working on LAR Chess as a hobby (on hold)
- [PROBABLY ABANDONED] Faaast Design. Template generator. 💰💰 (BRING THE IDEAS TO POINT NO. 2)
- [MAINTENANCE MODE] Realm - the next big thing "frontend framework". 🦄
